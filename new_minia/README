/*
To run the new version, type make in the directory to compile.

Then, type ./minia 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [8], where
1 = name of reads file (current format is each line has a string of characters representing the read)
2 = k
3 = read length
4 = number of distinct kmers.  This will be directly used to size the bloom filter so try to have a good estimate.
5 = false positive rate (.01 is a good base rate) 
6 = j.  j = 0 corresponds to taking direct extensions of the reads, j = 1 is extensions of extensions, etc.
7 = from_kmers.  Put in 0, it will be from_kmers = false, do it like normal from reads.  Put in 1, it does from kmers.
8 = junctions file name.  Will print out to this file. If no filename is given, no file will be printed.

[] indicate optional arguments.

This will load a bloom filter with all the kmers from the reads, then scan through them inserting potential false positives.
No error correction corrently, and no assembly.
