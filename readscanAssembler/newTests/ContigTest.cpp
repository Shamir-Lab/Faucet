// A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.
//
// Author: wan@google.com (Zhanyong Wan)


// This sample shows how to write a simple unit test for a function,
// using Google C++ testing framework.
//
// Writing a unit test using Google C++ testing framework is easy as 1-2-3:


// Step 1. Include necessary header files such that the stuff your
// test logic needs is declared.
//
// Don't forget gtest.h, which declares the testing framework.

#include "../Contig.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"


// Step 2. Use the TEST macro to define your tests.
//
// TEST has two parameters: the test case name and the test name.
// After using the macro, you should define your test logic between a
// pair of braces.  You can use a bunch of macros to indicate the
// success or failure of a test.  EXPECT_TRUE and EXPECT_EQ are
// examples of such macros.  For a complete list, see gtest.h.
//
// <TechnicalDetails>
//
// In Google Test, tests are grouped into test cases.  This is how we
// keep test code organized.  You should put logically related tests
// into the same test case.
//
// The test case name and the test name should both be valid C++
// identifiers.  And you should not use underscore (_) in the names.
//
// Google Test guarantees that each test you define is run exactly
// once, but it makes no guarantee on the order the tests are
// executed.  Therefore, you should write your tests in such a way
// that their results don't depend on their order.
//
// </TechnicalDetails>


// Tests Factorial().
// Tests factorial of negative numbers.
TEST(ContigTest, Construct) {
  Contig contig = Contig();

  EXPECT_EQ("", contig.getSeq());
  EXPECT_EQ(-1, contig.ind1);
  EXPECT_EQ(-1, contig.ind2);
}
