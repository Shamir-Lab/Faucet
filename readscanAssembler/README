***** Basic usage ****

To run Mink, first type make in the directory to compile.

Then, type ./mink, followed by the following arguments:
-reads_file <>, name of reads file (current format is each line has a string of characters representing the read)
-size_kmer k
-max_read_length <>, upper bound on the size of a read
-estimaed_kmers <>, number of number of distinct kmers.  This will be directly used to size the bloom filter so try to have a good estimate.
-fp <>, false positive rate, default .01
-j j, j = 0 corresponds to taking direct extensions of the reads, j = 1 is extensions of extensions, etc. Default value 1
-file_prefix <>, used for junctions file and contigs file and graph file
--two_hash, if this option is selected a bigger bloom filter with only two hash functions is used

This will load a bloom filter with all the kmers from the reads, then scan through them to find all of the junctions.
It will print all of the junctions to a file named file_prefix.junctions, 
and print some summary info about the run to stdout.
It will then build a graph from the junction map, clean tips from the graph, and print the contigs and the graph to files
file_prefix.contigs, file_prefix.graph.

**** Note *****
When you change Mink.cpp, you have to recompile it specifically using
"g++ --std=c++0x -c -o Mink.o Mink.cpp"
For every other sort of change, just type "make"
