To run Minia, type make in the directory to compile.

Then, type ./minia 1 2 3 4 5 6 [7] [8], where
1 = name of kmers file (current format is each line has a string of characters representing the kmer)
2 = k
3 = number of distinct kmers.  This will be used to size the bloom filter so try to have a good estimate.
4 = false positive rate (.01 is a good base rate) 
5 = j.  j = 0 corresponds to taking direct extensions of the reads, j = 1 is extensions of extensions, etc.
6 = junctions file name.  Will print out to this file. If no filename is given, no file will be printed.
7 = TwoHash.  True if you want to use a bigger bloom filter with only two hash functions.
    Can only use this is you also put in something for 7.
[] indicate optional arguments.

This will load a bloom filter with all the kmers from the reads, then scan through them inserting potential false positives.
No error correction corrently, and no assembly.


***BUG****
Since I'm bad at makefiles.
If you change Minia.cpp, the make will fail and say it needs the latest standard.
Type "g++ --std=c++0x -c -o Minia.o Minia.cpp" to recompile that separately.
Then make will work again.
